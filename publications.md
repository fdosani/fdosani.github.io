#### Open source projects

* [locopy](https://github.com/capitalone/Data-Load-and-Copy-using-Python): A
  friendly little package to help with loading / unloading data from Amazon
  Redshift. I'm currently working on adding support for Snowflake and most likely
  plain old Postgres after.

* [datacompy](https://github.com/capitalone/datacompy): A neat little package to
  give a readable output of compared Pandas and Spark data frames.

* [better-interviews](https://github.com/fdosani/better-interviews): An open source
  framework for conducting technical interviews
