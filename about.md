I'm a Data Scientist @ [Capital One](http://www.capitalone.ca). I thoroughly enjoy working there. The people are amazing, my manager is kick ass, and frankly I feel really blessed and honoured to have the ability to work on some amazing projects! As a "bank" there might be a perception of things being boring but honestly it is far from it.

We are redefining what it means to be a bank and doing it in style! We get to play around with the latest technologies, tools, and methodologies. I'm just happy I can be passionate about what it is I get to do day in and day out.
