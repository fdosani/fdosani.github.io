I thoroughly enjoy working there. The people are amazing, my manager is kick ass, and frankly I feel really blessed and honoured to have the ability to work on some amazing projects! As a \"bank\" there might be a perception of things being boring but honestly it is far from it.\r\n\r\nWe are redefining what it means to be a bank and doing it in style! We get to play around with the latest technologies, tools, and methodologies. I'm just happy I can be passionate about what it is I get to do day in and day out.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf you'd like to get in touch with me feel free to ping me at: faisal (dot) dosani (at) gmail.com\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
