#### AWS
I'm currently leading up the effort to on-board AWS at work which is super exciting!
We have some really great use cases which I'm hoping we can fully deploy by the end of the year
Having the ability to full automate with Cloud Formation templates, boto, and Ansible playbooks is going to be real nice!

#### Python
I have a Python t-shirt....nuff said. After immersing with SAS for so many years I've shifted off onto Python the last 2 years.
I've always been a fan of Open Source, and happy to be part of that eco system. It's moving so fast, and it has been amazing to see how its blown up the last
few years. Long live Anaconda!

#### SQL
Every data-barista knows SQL right?

{% highlight sql %}
select *
from coffee_shop
where
shop_type <> 'Starbucks'
and drink_type = 'Latte';
{% endhighlight %}
