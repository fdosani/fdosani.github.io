title: things I'm hoping to do in 2019
---

So I've totally neglected doing this blog for a while now. Hoping to change
that in the new year.

Some things I'd like to focus on:

- Learning a new language (Maybe Go or Ruby?)
- Being kinder to myself (Shaking off the imposter syndrome which haunts me daily)
- Contributing to a new Open source project. I'm thinking [engarde](https://github.com/TomAugspurger/engarde)
  would be great mainly because it is relevant, useful, and @TomAugspurger seems
  kick ass and someone I'd love to collaborate with.
