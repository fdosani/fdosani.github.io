title: pycon 2016
---

This past week I had the opportunity to attend pycon in Portland! All I can say
is WOW! What an amazing experience and time! The community is vibrant, diverse,
smart, curious, and welcoming.

In many ways the python community reminds me of the SAS community in that it is
heavily driven by people from the community on a volunteer basis, which naturally
makes sense given its open source nature.

There were many amazing talks on a variety of topics but just wanted to call out
the following ones which I really enjoyed and personally got a chance to attend.

#### REFACTORING PYTHON: WHY AND HOW TO RESTRUCTURE YOUR CODE

Its a great opportunity to meet your peers and learn about different views and
ways of doing things.
