So after some thinking, I had decided to shut down my consulting business. It's been dormant for almost 2 years now, and I didn't see myself returning to it in the near future, which is why I'm writing this blog post ironically.

As I wind down my company I'm shutting down my website, and various other services, and had to find a new home for some of my content. I'm a big fan of Github so it kind of made sense to use github.io to start hosting the relatively static stuff I'm paying for now.

With all that said..Welcome :)
