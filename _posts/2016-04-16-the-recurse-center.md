So this post is about [the Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com) which I stumbled upon in a interesting way.

I was checking out the [PyData](http://pydata.org/) site to double check if the DC edition was available for registration. If you haven't been to [PyData](http://pydata.org/), I highly recommend it. I attended the Seattle one in 2015 and was maybe one of the best conferences I've been too. BTW, [Capital One](http://www.capitalone.com) is sponsoring the [DC edition](http://pydata.org/dc2016/) for 2016. Something I'm really proud, and excited about.

Ultimately from there I ended up on Julia Evans' blog, and discovered [the Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com). Please check out [Julia's blog](http://jvns.ca/). It has great content, she seems awesome, and an alumni of RC.

The idea is to become a better programmer at [the Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com). The environment they have setup is a place where you can succeed, collaborate, learn, and teach with some of the brightest people.

After researching about it these last few days, this is something that I feel extremely passionate about. Something in side of me tells me this is an important step in my journey as a programmer, and frankly as a person. It might sound corny but I genuinely mean it.

I've always wanted to contribute to some open source software (OSS) or build something for the community which has given a lot to me personally. I may have not acted on this in the past but I want that to change. Working at [Capital One](http://www.capitalone.com) and seeing how the culture is slowly changing, and embracing OSS, I feel stronger about this than ever before.

I feel really excited, and hopeful about the possibility of joining [the Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com). Doesn't hurt I have my wife and manager fully willing to support me on that path.

*I started working on project Euler, and hoping to [post a solution](https://github.com/fdosani/project-euler) to each question as time permits. Just for fun!*
