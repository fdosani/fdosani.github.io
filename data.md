#### Main tech stack

* Python 3.6+
* Apache Spark
* AWS (EC2, EMR, S3, RDS, ELB, ASG, etc.)
    - ELB/ASG are particularly useful in front of some flask apps I've built
* SQL: Postgres, Snowflake, Redshift, Teradata
    - Been super surprised by Postgres when it comes to speed and versatility.
* CircleCI, and TravisCI for automated testing
    - Circle internally, and Travis for OS projects
* git and GitHub
* bash (the duct tape)
