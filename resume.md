Most recent projects (2018 onwards):

- Leading a team on Transaction Fraud
  - Spark, Python (`pyspark`, SQL), `h2o`, hacking bash scripts

  - Coordinating priorities, leading sprints, and getting things into production

- Building out a Python framework for Customer valuations modeling and analysis:
  - Done in Python, `numpy`, `pandas`, `numba`
  - optimized for speed
  - design (reusability, architecture, code quality)


Previous Stuff:

I've worked on a variety of projects during my time at Capital One. I started
off working in the SVI (Statistics, Valuations, and Infrastructure) team
building the framework which our models run on. This was a SAS heavy role which
required complex querying, and coding of the all the interactions which go
into real-time model and batch scoring.

I've lead our internal training for Canadian associates for Python, Git,
Unix/Linux, and even got to train some of our US associates as we started to
transform the culture and tool set at Capital One.

I was the main product owner (coordinated with 5+ teams from development to
production roll-out) for one of my personally favorite projects called
Enhanced Transactions. I lead my small team (myself and 2 others) to
breakdown the existing US code base and adapt it for our intent in Canada.
The project involves complex pipelines of Hadoop jobs which distil
information about transactions and map them back to public information to
present a friendly and concise customer experience. Lots of Python, MR,
Hadoop, Luigi, and some ML to top it off.

I'm also the lead for our digital marketing data pipelines where we interface
with Google Adwords, Bing, and FB. This will be one of our first full blown uses
cases into AWS as we build a "Data Product" which will manage our end to end
marketing operations and optimizations.

#### 2 Four Three / Consultant / Toronto / March 2011 --> May 2014
I started my own consulting company working with old partners at RBC and
Capital One. A lot of the services I provided were based on my SAS & SQL
expertise. At RBC I did lots of campaign analytics such as A/B testing, pre-post
campaign analysis, along with channel optimization tests.

Basically think of it as offering the best deal at the right time (when the
customer comes to you!)

#### Everything before / Developer-Analyst-Something-Something / Toronto-Sydney-Montreal / <= February 2011
To keep this short, I've worked in a variety of industries, and done some
interesting roles. I've was a Java Web Developer building apps to provide
criminal history checks via govt agencies. I've done automated testing for
Enterprise level backup software, and complex reporting applications to
streamline/simplify overhead for marketing campaigns.
