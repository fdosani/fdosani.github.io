#### Capital One / Manager, Data Science / Toronto / June 2014 --> Now  
I've worked on a variety of projects during my time at Capital One. I started off working in the SVI (Statistics, Valuations, and Infrastructure) team building the framework which our models run on. This was a SAS heavy role which required complex querying, and coding of the all the interactions which go into real-time model and batch scoring.

I've lead our internal training for Canadian associates for Python, Git, Unix/Linux, and even got to train some of our US associates as we started to transform the culture and tool set at Capital One.

I was the main product owner (coordinated with 5+ teams from development to production roll-out) for one of my personally favorite projects called Enhanced Transactions. I lead my small team (myself and 2 others) to breakdown the existing US code base and adapt it for our intent in Canada. The project involves complex pipelines of Hadoop jobs which distil information about transactions and map them back to public information to present a friendly and concise customer experience. Lots of Python, MR, Hadoop, Luigi, and some ML to top it off.

I'm also the lead for our digital marketing data pipelines where we interface with Google Adwords, Bing, and FB. This will be one of our first full blown uses cases into AWS as we build a "Data Product" which will manage our end to end marketing operations and optimizations.

Finally I'm leading the Canadian AWS effort, collaborating with US partners and TECH.

#### 2 Four Three / Consultant / Toronto / March 2011 --> May 2014
I started my own consulting company working with old partners at RBC and Capital One.
A lot of the services I provided were based on my SAS & SQL expertise.
At RBC I did lots of campaign analytics such as A/B testing, pre-post campaign analysis,
along with channel optimization tests.

Basically think of it as offering the best deal at the right time (when the customer comes to you!)

#### Everything before / Developer-Analyst-Something-Something / Toronto-Sydney-Montreal / <= February 2011
To keep this short, I've worked in a variety of industries, and done some interest roles. I've was a Java Web Developer building apps to provide criminal history checks via govt agencies. I've done automated testing for Enterprise level backup software, and complex reporting applications to streamline/simplify overhead for marketing campaigns.
